# EdgeAI surveillance monitoring anomaly detection

(Work in Progress)
An Edge AI pipeline to implement learning and inference onto surveillance cameras to detect anomalies such as accidents. 
Objects and motions are extracted from video stream using existing methods: background subtraction methods, object detection methods such as YOLO and Motion histograms. The anomaly detection model is built on top of it in a simple manner to allow the algorithm/pipeline to run at the Edge.

The full code is not released as the method is still being tested and the paper is being prepared to submit for publication.

To explore: online learning of new information at the edge.
