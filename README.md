# EdgeAI surveillance monitoring anomaly detection

(Work in Progress)
An Edge AI pipeline to implement learning and inference onto surveillance cameras to detect anomalies such as accidents. 
Objects and motions are extracted from video stream using background subtraction methods, object detection methods such as YOLO and Motion histograms. The anomaly detection model is built on top of it in a simple manner to allow the algorithm to run at the Edge.

The code is not yet complete as the method is still being tested.

To explore: online learning of new information at the edge.
